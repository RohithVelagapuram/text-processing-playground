Software development is the process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining applications. 
Good software is not only functional but also readable, efficient, and easy to maintain. 
Developers focus on writing clear logic, organizing code properly, and solving real-world problems. 
Consistent practice and small projects help improve problem-solving skills and technical confidence. 
Learning by building simple tools is one of the most effective ways to grow as a programmer.
